## 1. First Project: Build a Rock Paper Scissors

Project Url: <https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/rock-paper-scissors>

Solution Url: <>

For this challenge, you will create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.

In the file RPS.py you are provided with a function called player. The function takes an argument that is a string describing the last move of the opponent ("R", "P", or "S"). The function should return a string representing the next move for it to play ("R", "P", or "S").

A player function will receive an empty string as an argument for the first game in a match since there is no previous play.

The file RPS.py shows an example function that you will need to update. The example function is defined with two arguments (player(prev_play, opponent_history = [])). The function is never called with a second argument so that one is completely optional. The reason why the example function contains a second argument (opponent_history = []) is because that is the only way to save state between consecutive calls of the player function. You only need the opponent_history argument if you want to keep track of the opponent_history.

Hint: To defeat all four opponents, your program may need to have multiple strategies that change depending on the plays of the opponent.
